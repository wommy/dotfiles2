Application Details - Questions


If a Detroit Labs team member referred you, who was it?

  Steve Barman
  Brian Hauer

We are seeking Developer, Designer, and QA Engineer interns. Which role are you applying for? Why?

  Developer
  I've been freelancing websites for a couple years now. Its something I care about and enjoy doing.
  I feel that the only way to get better is to work on it 8 hours a day, surrounded by creatives at some digital agency.

If you have a Github account, what’s your ID?

  www.github.com/wommy

If you are applying for the Designer role, please provide a link to your portfolio:

Where did you hear about Detroit Labs?

  "conference talk", but really local meet-ups such as DetroitJS and SemJS

What’s your professional work history? What kinds of projects have you worked on? If you've worked for any technology companies, what were they and what did you do, and have you shipped any projects?

  I moved to Detroit suddenly, almost 3 years ago, after my dad died. For those past few years, I've been caregiving, as my grandma and two uncles followed, shortly one after another.

  Before, I lived in Chicago for seven years. I interned at the Thinkubator, a creative meeting space, specializing in extracurricular office activities. I ran 30+ websites for them, mostly WordPress, as well as helped in the production of over a dozen events they threw over the 6 months I was there. I continued freelancing for them until about a year ago.

  After that I worked at Original Graphics Printing, which was a print shop that specialized in t-shirts and decals for store fronts and vehicles. I created and ran websites for them and their clients, which included a local pizzeria, a concrete / landscaping company, a makeup store, hair salons, barbershops, etc.   

If you know any programming languages, what are they? What software tools do you like to use?

  I primarily write javascript. In college I dabbled in ruby, python, php. Right now I'm focusing on learning preact, functional, but have been exploring go. Day by day I'm getting better at vim and zsh, but am currently typing to you in atom on a chromebook running Ubuntu 16.04.

  I make static sites primarily using spike, a Static Site Generator created by Jeff Escalante, previously of Vice Media's Carrot, who now works at Hashicorp. It is built upon webpack, using babel, postcss, preact, and reshape: their version of jade / pug / haml. Another Static Site Generator I've been experimenting with is Gatsby. I met Kyle Mathews over a year ago and have held a loose connection with him ever since.

Do you have any work samples, blog posts, public speaking engagements, or anything else like that you'd like to share?

  In October 2015 my macbook pro died and I only had a few of my sites backed up. I have since moved to 100% github. I'm going to list some noteworthy repos and give them a light description of why they're worth mentioning.

  My first commit to github was creating /technomad. Loosely, technomad is my stack. It was first built with a program called mixture, which was a static site generator using liquid, a ruby templating language. The company closed two months after I finished creating my website and took down all its documentation. I then moved to Jekyll, where I stayed for about a year. Not liking ruby made me look for a javascript static site generator, one of the quality I desired I could not find. I ended up making my own with npm scripts that you can find under /c9_npmbp_technomad. Last year I discovered spike, which did everything I dreamed of and more, I immediately ported my site to it. Those files are at /www-wommyio. Looking at my repos, you can see experiments with Hugo, Forestry.io, and Victor_Hugo /hugo_test /test_forestry, /test_hugo, /restaurant-template-cms, as well as sites for friends, /rovin_funneler, /oley_revive, /ericJS. I've also mucked about with NetlifyCMS, /kaldi-hugo-cms-template and gatsby, /technomad-gatsbifyCMS. I have a really old basic jekyll blog at /jekyll-lanyon.

Describe something you are passionate about. It can be but doesn’t have to be related to software or technology. How did you discover this thing, why does it incite your passion, and what do you do about it?

  I studied Wing Chun for two years in Chicago. I was struggling at the time, I felt very powerless in everything I was doing. I was pretty much a junior in college and I was taking all these design classes, and due to conflicts with the teachers, I had really low self-esteem. Wing Chun really helped me with discipline, as I could see results from putting in time practicing, which translated to me feeling in control of my life. During this time I also rode a bicycle, something I did for 6 years. You can find a video I produced here: https://vimeo.com/122390839

Pretend that you are in a job that you absolutely love. What is the thing that you spend the most time doing in this dream job?

  In a word, I would say: discovery. I think theres a real beauty in finding elegant yet powerful solutions to common problems. Most problems I have, I feel like have already been solved by someone somewhere, its just a matter of finding it. I really love combing the internet for those solutions, which I would describe as a very introverted activity, but then traveling to meetups to meet the geniuses who invented the solution, which is an extroverted activity. I have been traveling to NYC and SF for conferences for over a year now.

Describe the last brand new (to you) thing that you studied and became good at. Why did you learn this new thing? What was your learning process like?

  About 6 months ago, I practiced Judo, for around 6 months. The coolest part about learning Judo is that the information hierarchy is a type of peer to peer. You go to the Dojo, where the class of between 5 to 25, congregate, day to day. You stretch, based on exercises they've taught you, then you run drills with a partner for 5 to 60 minutes, which vary from class to class, week by week.

  The coolest part was learning everyone else's learning style; it was very cool bonding with fellow other people who were each trying to learn a certain thing. In a certain instance, the sensai struggled with the words to articulate how to express, physically, a certain type of throw, and one of the elder students stepped up, and said something simple like: you just put your hip into it. Suddenly clairvoyance! I got it, and I could help this other student to get it, and she could help this other guy, so on. Its so cool understanding thats its okay that different people ascertain different things at different rates with different types of words and that at the end of the day we are all a community.

If I was able to take a quick peek at your bookshelf, Kindle library, or wherever you keep your books and things you like to read, what would I find? Interested in fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels, anything.

  I do read manga / comic books / graphic novels, I'm just about to finish Scott Pilgram. Others I have liked are Akira, Hellboy, Watchmen, V for Vendetta.

  A couple books I have around the house currently in no specific order are: Lao Tzu: the Art of War, Eugene Debs: Labor and Freedom, Joseph Campbell: the Hero with a Thousand Faces, Ester Perel: Mating in Captivity.

  I mostly read stuff from reddit, topics span from politics, technology, philosophy, to history.

Tell me a story about the last thing you failed at, or didn’t achieve what you wanted to achieve. Yes, this question is clichéd, but we really want to know and we treat it with respect. If you tell me you fail at sleeping in and taking time off because you are so devoted to your work, you’re automatically disqualified. So, what happened? Why? Whose fault was it? What did you do after?

  I wrote this about the last question about books, but I feel like it applies better here so I'm moving it:   Mating in Captivity was a great book about everyone's favorite thing, monogamy! I was struggling in a relationship and it really gave me a handful of terms in which I could measure and classify different arguments I was having with my partner. I really wanted to make the relationship work, and while it wasn't made to be, what I learned from the book allowed me to set healthy boundaries which allowed me to decide how I was going to move forward with a person that I really cared about that, that occupied a substantial part of my life. Since love is a very sensitive issue, I wanted to turn to an expert opinion. I first learned about Ester Perel from a TED Talk that really resonated with me.

  I don't like to place blame or fault when dealing with relationships because it always ends up being a little bit of both people's fault. My failed relationship is something I'm still dealing with.

OK. Here’s your chance. Fill in a question you really wanted me to ask, that question you most want to answer:

  Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

So, what’s the answer to that question?

  I would like to improve my javascript skills and create a better faster stronger wordpress. Maybe I'd freelance a dozen clients and travel the world working from coffee shops.
